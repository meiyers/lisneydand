    <h1>The Artist</h1>
    <p>Mei Lin Meyers</p>
    <p>Here's <a href="sap4_Mei_P2.html">Back to the start</a></p>
    <p>Mei Lin Meyers is an artist. They  have watched Mamma Mia! (2008) an approximated 50 times.

        <br>
        Mei Lin Meyers was born in 2002, into a family. 
        At an age before she can remember Meyers was given a yellow book decorated with brown and purple spots. It was curious. 
        <br> Here Mei Lin was introduced to the great Renaissance man, Folin Cirth. Folin Cirth was and still is shrounded in mystery!
        <br> The man, her biological father is an artist. Cirth is a painter of theory, the writer of on the nose facebook posts
        <br> an alum to every university and product of every institution!

        <br> Mei Lin was born of mystery! Conceived in Europe by Meryl Larx and Folin Cirth(?). Daughter to mother Meryl and dad Steve
        <br> Raised in a white household Mei Lin thought she was adopted. Folin Cirth was off reinventing the wheel. Meryl taught children
        <br> whereas Steve sold plates.
        <br> They grew up in the elusive Hills. Born of mystery and Westmead Children's Hospital!!

        <br> Mei Lin is currently a Fine Arts student at UNSW Art & Design (COFA - Corruption of Fine Artists) and is titilated by soft sculpture.
        <br> According to the internet Mei Lin means jade tree, plum tree and according to Meryl 'pretty'. The institutions (THE INSTITUTIONS!)
        <br> are unaccustomed to 'Mei Lin'. Centerlink (wrong - 'Mei-Lin') Medicare (wrong - 'Mei-Lin') Service NSW (wrong 'Mei' (middle name Lin))
        <br> HCF (wrong - 'Mei-Lin') USI (wrong 'Mei-Lin') 
        <br> Until 2020 Mei Lin (in all these forms), did not exist; excluded from the system (THE INSTITUTIONS!!) by spelling mistake.
        <br> Until 2020 Mei Lin's health care records have been wrong.
        <br> But never fear; Mei Lin is related to the Rennaisance man. Nature and a need to explore the self (in a quite frankly obsessive manner)
        <br> has made them an artist.

        <br> A sick artist. A maker of plates, playlists and tentacles. 
        
        
        Her great grandfather was supposedly a brilliant writer based in Hangzhou.
