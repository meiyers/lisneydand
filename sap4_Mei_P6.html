    I fall, peering through the half worlds visible in the reflections made on water and glass.
    <br> The point of juncture, that captures my confessions. 
    <br> Glimpses tinted green, early morning search engine, restless, failing to take shape. Shadows become singular. 
    <br> Beams of jade illuminating, building rooms full of code and stifled angst. 
    <br> A microcosm distorted in its vision, a performance captured in only its grief. </p>

            Meiling North Road strolls across the reduced landscape, webbing its way towards Xi Hu. Spring onions sprout from the crevices in between pixels. 
            The pavement flecked with spots of green and white. I pull the onions from these empty fields. Eyes stinging as I peck the ashes. 
            The resistive touch which brings forth a collapse. The roots become the leaf, the green is left uneaten. 
            An aroma condensed and remembered that fades into the dark. Cells rendered into digits, turned inwards to feast on themselves. 
            Names. Derivatives. Sought out between the grid of the lake. Facade that threatens to break as I drop pins into the surface. 
            Pin pricks that fail as they attempt to expand, inflate castles from the spindling lines engraved into my retinas.

        Great Grandfather asks for a Chinese cigarette, a request made with a singular breath. 
        <br> He sits beside Xi Hu, spinning tales from ruffled feathers. 
        <br> Vision unfocusing, losing sight of the horizon. The line disrupted by subordinate cartography, where the Earth and the sky fail to meet. 
        <br> Mapped out, the globe popped and deflated.  
        <br>I run my knife along the edge of the orange, splitting seams and laying the pocked skin bare. <br>
        I pick at it. Leaving scars. A reflection of celestial tears on my back. Acne that bleeds, transferring kisses onto my clothing.<br>
         And still I remain hunched. <br>
         Sifting through the remnants, the stones left along desiccated beds. <br>
         A millennium of passion, joy and heartbreak which pools at my feet. 
         <br> Teasing me as it imitates the ebb and flow of the non existent dawn. <br>
         The boundary made visible only in its absence, in the dissipation of smoke in the faltering wind. <br>

        <br> A blue, slightly geometric shape nestled between spindling lines on Google Maps. In this constructed version/vision the mountains are flattened, indiscernible. 
        <br>The topical curves rendered meaningless, divorced from objective space and the feeling of rain as it condenses.
        <br> A cyber mirage formed by fluctuating language, embedded with faltering memory. A footprint. 
        <br> Xi Hu's storybook interpretation splayed out on the contorting cloud.
