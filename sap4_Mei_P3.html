        <i> A yellow book with spots, brown and purple. Very 2000s reject shop. The curdling of the spine, the adhesive now rendered useless. 
        <br>I wish my grandpa was here to fix it. Stick it back together. I am attracted to the unknown, even as I know that the image I create, 
        <br>the fiction will be more resolved than the reality. It is never the right time. Instead, I am caught up with fables, dancing with Xi Hu. 
        <br>A fraud in a raincoat. Telling too much, never too little. I feel the most when I am stressed. I am faster, warm, nauseous. 
        <br>Are these the butterflies in my stomach, Liang Shangbo and Zhu Yingtai? The state of overwhelm. 
        <br>Shame as I search.</i>
